# Machine-Learning-KNN-SVM-LAB-5,6

This repo contains Lab practices of Machine Learning performed in Jupyter Notebook using Python language

ðŸš€ LAB-5: K-Nearest Neighbors

â—¾ LAB 5 ipynb file consists of the basic python coding required to perform the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier on a given data set and visualize the results. This code files uses the iris dataset file to perform the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier and Visualizes the results using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

ðŸš€ LAB-6: Support Vector Machine

â—¾ LAB 6 ipynb file consists of the basic python coding required to perform the Support Vector Machine Classifier on a given data set and visualize the results. This code files uses the iris dataset file to perform the Support Vector Machine Classifier and Visualizes the results using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
